we are given a sorted array and have to perform operation on the sorted array
we take two pointer indices
int start=0;
int end= sizeofArray-1
while(start<=end){
we calculate the mid index
 int mid= start + (end-start)/2
 if(key= arr[mid]){
   return the index as the key element is found
   }
   
 else if(key > arr[mid]){
    start= mid+1
    }
 else if(key< arr[mid]){
  end= mid -1
 }
 
 if all this is done 
 }
 
 this means that the key is not present in the array
 retrun -1
 
 }
 
 every time we are reducing our array size by half that is size/2
 so space is reduced by half
 time complexity-> log(n)
